<h1> About Me </h1>
  <text> Hello, my name is Jason and I've been writing since I was in the third grade. My goal has a writer is to impact people all throughout the
  world in a positive light; especially with all the worldwide crisis and conflict going on. I specialize in a wide variety of genres
  including poetry, songwriting, short stories, and playwriting. </text> 
  
  <text> Writing gives me an outlet that I normally don't express when I'm in public; and seperating who I am 
    as a person/athlete { (oh yeah, I play volleyball and soccer :) } from the writer I am is impossible; empowering, vulnerable, and enlightening.</text>
  
  I'm proud to say that I'm currently pursuing my BFA in Creative Writing at Arizona State University. </text>

<h2> Inspiration & Writing Style </h2>
  <text> I prefer my writing style to be upfront with various topics like love, adolescence, and internal conflict. Whereas some writers prefer to hide 
  themselves behind a pen and paper, I prefer to use those tools as a means of expressing myself out to the world. My biggest inspirations are Kiana Lede, H.E.R
  and Ella Mai; and one of my goals is to follow in their footsteps by co-writing or featuring on a Grammy-winning record.
  My writing style emulates their songwriting- which is very true to their hearts and themselves.</text>
