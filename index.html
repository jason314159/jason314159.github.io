<h1> About Me </h1>
  <text> Hello, my name is Jason and I've been writing since I was in the third grade. My goal has a writer is to impact people all throughout the
  world in a positive light; especially with all the worldwide crisis and conflict going on. I specialize in a wide variety of genres
  including poetry, songwriting, short stories, and playwriting. Writing gives me an outlet that I normally don't express when I'm in public; and seperating
  who I am as a person/athlete { (oh yeah, I play volleyball and soccer :) } from the writer I am is impossible; empowering, vulnerable, and enlightening.
  
  I'm proud to say that I'm pursuing my BFA in Creative Writing at Arizona State University. </text>
